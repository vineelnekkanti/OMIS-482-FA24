    "text": "Getting Started aka Running code in R\nTo run and execute code inside a code chunk simply click the Run Code button or make sure that your cursor is anywhere in the line that you want to execute and press Cmd(Mac)/Ctrl(Windows) + Enter to run a single line of code or highlight multiple line and then press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter. Let’s try with the below code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages installation\nYou will need to install the packages first before be able to use functions and datasets they contain. This is a one time task unless you uninstall R& RStudio or you change your computer. We will need to install a few packages, among them the most important is tidyverse. Tidyverse is the main package for the first part of the semester, it is a bundle package (meaning it contains multiple packages that have different purposes e.g., dplyr for manipulations, ggplot for visualizations)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad packages\nThis is a critical task. Every time you open a new RStudio session you will need to load the packages. Failing to do so will incur in the most common errors among beginners (e.g., function not found or object not found)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake careful note of the conflicts message that’s printed when you load the tidyverse. It tells you that dplyr overwrites some functions in base R. If you want to use the base version of these functions after loading dplyr, you’ll need to use their full names: stats::filter() and stats::lag().\n\n\nNeed help\nIf you are stuck promise me not to quit! You are a beginner so it will happen. Just pay attention to the error message and look at the below option to find a solution:\n\nlook into the R community or Stackoverflow\nleverage LLM (e.g., ChatGPT)\nuse help with R documentation (e.g., try ?mean below)\ncheck examples of how to use a certain function (e.g., try example(“mean”) below)\n\nNB During the exams you can only use the last two options so make sure you master them!",

You can then call and use the object created later.\nThe shortcut option/alt + - will create the assign symbol\n\n\nHow to manage object?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to name your objects?\nObject names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .. You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s check your object creation understanding. Given the object below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happen if I run the following lines; why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 1: Create objects by using the assignment operator (6 minutes) [write code just below each instruction; finally use Teams RStudio - Forum channel for help on the in-class activities/homework or if you have other questions]\n#a. An object named “today” that is equal to todays’ date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#b. An object named “forty” that is equal to 6*5 +10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#c. An object named “basic_sum” that is equal to 1+2+3+4+5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#d. Write also the code to print the today object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing functions\nFunctions are the real reason why you should use R. There are too many functions to go over or even try remember. In fact, each package will give you access to a different set of functions and sometimes they will use the same name (e.g., remember the conflict with the filter function above). However, the good news is that you don’t need to memorize them but understand how they work. Let’s start with a basic example, how can we create a sequence of numbers in R?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity 2: Use basic functions (8 minutes) [write code just below each instruction; finally use Teams RStudio - Forum channel for help on the in class activities/homework or if you have other questions]\n#a. Learn more about the sum function (hint: use the help feature covered today)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#b. Use the sum function to compute the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 1000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#c. Assign the above function to an object named “my_first_function”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#d. Print the object “my_first_function”",
